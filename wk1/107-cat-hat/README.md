## The Input

The input consists of a sequence of cat-in-hat specifications. Each specification is a single line consisting of two positive integers, separated by white space. The first integer is the height of the initial cat, and the second integer is the number of worker cats.

A pair of 0's on a line indicates the end of input.

## The Output

For each input line (cat-in-hat specification), print the number of cats that are not working, followed by a space, followed by the height of the stack of cats. There should be one output line for each input line other than the ``0 0'' that terminates input.
